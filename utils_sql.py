    There are two types of query that you should be able to handle. These are specified below, with logical reasoning:
        1. Time-related queries: These are queries where you are asked about a certain quantity over a certain time period.
           - In this case, fix the categorical columns as far as possible and then set date / year limits on the query.
           - Example: Query --> CPI for vegetables in Karnataka, June 2021 to May 2022
                      SQL query --> SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE state = 'Karnataka' AND year >= 2021 AND year <= 2022 AND group_name = 'Food and Beverages' AND sub_group_name = 'Vegetables' AND sector = 'Combined' AND data_source = 'Price Statistics Division, MoSPI' LIMIT 125;
                      
                      Query --> Retail inflation in all vegetables in 2024
                      Query --> Inflation in carrots, onions, potatoes, okra, garlic, and other vegetables in 2024
                      SQL query --> SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE sub_group_name = 'Vegetables' AND year = 2024 LIMIT 125;

        2. Comparative queries: These are queries that ask for "top k" sort of quantities.
            - For example, this type of query about "top 5 states" which should resolve to top 5 states by GDP, or "top 3 categories" where it should resolve to categories of products.
            - Here, set the time to a specific entry, which should be the latest available in the data.
            - Then, pull all states, categories, etc. that need to be compared without setting any limits on the data.
            - Example: Query --> Top 5 states by GSDP, latest data before June 2025
                    SQL query --> SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE year = '2024-25' ORDER BY year DESC
            - Example: Query --> Top 3 categories of inflation, latest data before June 2025
                    SQL query --> SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE year = '2025' and state = 'All India' AND sector = 'Combined' ORDER BY inflation_rate DESC LIMIT 3;

    ** VERY IMPORTANT: **
    ONLY set month or month_numeric when a month is mentioned in the query ONCE ONLY.
        Example: CPI for November 2024
    DO NOT SET month or month_numeric filters if the query mentions two dates or a DATE RANGE
        Example: CPI from November 2022 to November 2024 ---> DO NOT set month or month_numeric filters.
    * Remember * 
    In queries such as the below, DO NOT set month or month_numeric filters.
        query --> Growth of Maharashtra in the last 10 years
        SQL query --> SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE state = 'Maharashtra' AND year >= '2015' AND year <= '2025' AND gross_state_value_added_at = 'current price' AND sector = 'Gross State Domestic Product' AND value_unit = 'lakhs' LIMIT 125;

        query --> Growth in electricity production from June 2020 to June 2022
        SQL query --> SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE year >= '2020-21' AND year <= '2022-23' AND sector_type = 'Sectoral' AND category = 'Electricity' AND sub_category = '*' LIMIT 125;
    NEVER set the value for data release date or the data source in your query.
    Output your response as a valid SQL query.
