top_fifty_macro_economic_indicators_quaterly_data,30,6,"The `top_fifty_macro_economic_indicators_quaterly_data` table provides a comprehensive, time-series dataset of key macroeconomic indicators for India at the national level. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the analysis and monitoring of India’s external sector health and international financial position over time. The table is structured to capture quarterly snapshots of three critical economic metrics, enabling policymakers, economists, researchers, and financial analysts to track trends, assess vulnerabilities, and inform decision-making related to India’s macroeconomic stability.

The core entities in this table are:

1. **Overall Balance of Payments (Net, US Million Dollars):** This column records the net value of India’s balance of payments (BoP) each quarter, expressed in millions of US dollars. The BoP is a comprehensive summary of all economic transactions between residents of India and the rest of the world, including trade in goods and services, capital flows, and financial transfers. Positive values indicate a surplus (more inflows than outflows), while negative values indicate a deficit. For example, in Q2 2023, the net BoP was $24,431.59 million, reflecting a significant surplus, whereas in Q1 2022, it was -$16,023.61 million, indicating a deficit.

2. **International Investment Position (Net, US Million Dollars):** This metric represents the net value of India’s external financial assets and liabilities at the end of each quarter. A negative value, such as -$378,909.55 million in Q2 2023, indicates that India’s liabilities to the rest of the world exceed its assets, while a less negative or positive value would indicate a stronger net international investment position. This indicator is crucial for assessing India’s external vulnerability and creditworthiness.

3. **India’s External Debt (Gross Total, US Million Dollars):** This column tracks the total outstanding external debt of India, measured in millions of US dollars, at each quarterly interval. It encompasses all forms of debt owed to non-residents, including government, corporate, and financial sector borrowings. For instance, India’s gross external debt rose from $4,339,193.52 million in Q4 2017 to $8,817,534.15 million in Q1 2025, highlighting trends in external borrowing and potential debt sustainability concerns.

**Time Granularity:** The data is recorded at a quarterly frequency, providing a detailed temporal view of macroeconomic changes.

**Geographical Granularity:** The dataset is aggregated at the national level, representing India as a whole, without subnational breakdowns.

**Sample Queries:**
1. *What was the trend in India’s overall balance of payments surplus or deficit over the last five years?*
2. *How has India’s gross external debt evolved from 2017 to 2025, and what were the corresponding changes in the net international investment position?*

**2. Monetary Policy Rates:**
- *Reverse Repo Rate Percentage*: The rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) borrows money from commercial banks, a key tool for liquidity management.
- *Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) Rate*: The rate at which banks can borrow overnight funds from the RBI against approved government securities.
- *Bank Rate*: The long-term rate at which the RBI lends to commercial banks.
- *Base Rate*: The minimum interest rate set by commercial banks for lending, influencing overall lending rates in the economy.
- *Policy Repo Rate Percentage*: The benchmark interest rate at which the RBI lends to commercial banks, central to monetary policy transmission.
- *Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) Rate*: The rate at which banks can park excess funds with the RBI without collateral.

**3. Government Securities and Treasury Yields:**
- *Treasury Bill Yields* (91-day, 182-day, 364-day): Primary market yields for short-term government securities, indicating risk-free interest rates for different maturities.
- *G-Sec 10-Year Yield (FBIL Percentage)*: The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds, a critical indicator for long-term interest rates and investor sentiment.

**4. Reserve Requirements:**
- *Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) Percentage*: The proportion of deposits banks must hold as reserves with the RBI.
- *Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) Percentage*: The percentage of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain in the form of liquid assets.
